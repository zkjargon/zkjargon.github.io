## Contributing Translations

We welcome contributions for translations into different languages. Follow these steps to add a new translation:

1. Ensure you have the required tools installed:

   ```
   cargo install mdbook mdbook-i18n-helpers
   ```

2. Generate the POT file:

   ```
   MDBOOK_OUTPUT='{"xgettext": {}}' mdbook build -d po
   ```

3. Create a new PO file for your language (replace `xx` with your language code):

   ```
   msginit -i po/messages.pot -l xx -o po/xx.po
   ```

4. Translate the strings in the newly created `po/xx.po` file. You can use a PO editor like Poedit for this task.

5. To preview your translation, run:

   ```
   MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=xx mdbook serve --open
   ```

6. Once you're satisfied with your translation, create a pull request with your changes.

7. To build all language versions at once, use the `build_all.sh` script:

```sh
./build_all.sh
```

This script will automatically build the book for all available language translations.
Note: On Windows, this command will automatically execute the appropriate PowerShell script.

### Translation Guidelines

For detailed translation guidelines, please refer to our [TRANSLATE.md](TRANSLATE.md) file. Some key points to remember:

- Use a PO editor (like Poedit) to edit `.po` files. Do not edit them by hand.
- Maintain consistency in terminology throughout the translation.
- Do not translate code blocks unless necessary.
- If you're unsure about a translation, leave it in English or add a translator's note.
