Shared inputs to both the prover and verifier of a [SNARK](./snark.md). Sometimes used interchangeably with the term **statement** although these terms are not exactly the same[^1].

[^1]: The terms instance, witness and statement come from complexity theory and the study of relations. An entry on "Relations" is in the works!
